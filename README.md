# PDF Chat Bot
## Project Overview
Many people avoid reading long PDFs and contracts. With the help of Generative AI and the Open AI API, we can create an application that can summarize and answer any questions about a PDF. This project utilizes the streamlit application and front end development to analyze PDF files of any length. It then summarizes the document and can also be utilized as a chat bot to answer any questions about the PDF. This application is beneficial for long contracts, documents, and resume screenings.
